##event_manager
This is my implementation of event_manager that has been adapted from The Turing School’s and Jump Start Lab’s Event Manager and updated to use GoogleCivic API.

##The techniques practiced:

* File input and output
* Reading data from CSV files
* String manipulation
* Accessing Sunlight’s Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* Using ERB for templating
